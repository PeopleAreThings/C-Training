# Learning C Programming

This repository contains my personal notes and code examples as I work through "The C Programming Language" (2nd Edition) by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie.

## About This Repository

This is a learning repository where I document my journey through the K&R C book. Each section contains:
- Code examples from the book
- My solutions to exercises
- Personal notes and insights
- Additional practice problems

Each chapter directory follows the same structure:
- `exercises/`: Contains solutions to end-of-chapter exercises
- `notes/`: Contains markdown files with personal notes and insights
- `examples/`: Contains example code from the book and practice programs

## How to Use This Repository

- Navigate to specific chapters to find related code and notes
- Exercise solutions are named according to their numbers (e.g., `ex1-1.c` for Exercise 1-1)
- Notes are provided in markdown format with explanations and key concepts
- All programs can be compiled using a standard C compiler

## Building and Running

To compile any of the C programs:

```bash
gcc program_name.c -o program_name
./program_name
```

## Learning Resources

- Primary Resource: "The C Programming Language" (2nd Edition) by Kernighan & Ritchie
- [C Standard Library Reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c)
